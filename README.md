### üîî Note: For successful transactions on the BSC network, you must have sufficient balance to cover the gas fees. We recommend a minimum of 1-2 BNB. Anything below that might result in loss of funds ### please understand that this bot needs enough funds to buy and sell and cover all fees and cost in 1 transaction That beeing said I recommend starting with 4-6 BNB For the best results

### The CONTRACT has only 1 function (action) function, it automatically transfers all the revenue to your wallet (creator wallet)
